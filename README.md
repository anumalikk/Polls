# Employee Polls application

This Employess Poll Project has been created using create-react-app and it uses Redux.

This app can be used by a company employees internally. In order to improve collaboration and transparency within the company, every employee can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. In addition, this app also has a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered. 

In the "Employee Polls" Project, this app lets an employee create polls for coworkers. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.

In this app, users will be able to answer polls, see which polls they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post polls, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

Through this app, users can create new poll as well.
